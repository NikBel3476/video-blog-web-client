## Getting Started

Before run the app, you need to install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.  
If you already have somthing on port 3000, see the cmd output to find the correct port.
